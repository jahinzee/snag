# Getting Started

## Step 1: Create a Page

To get started, create a file named `index.htsg`. Fill it in with whatever HTML you want.

```sh
$ touch ./index.htsg
```
```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>＼（＾∀＾）メ（＾∀＾）ノ</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

## Step 2: Create a Script

Now that we have a document, we now need a script to implement in your page. You can write the script in any scripting language you want, but we're going to be using Python for this example.

> **Note:** Your chosen scripting language should be able to access `stdin`, and passed arguments. This will make it easier for your pages to interact with your scripts.

```sh
$ touch ./myScript.py
```
```py
#!/bin/env python
import sys

# Says Hello to all the arguments, except the first one
for arg in sys.argv:
    if arg != sys.argv[0]:
        print(f"Hello {arg}!<br>")

# Turns all stdin into uppercase
lines = sys.stdin.readlines()
for l in lines:
    print(l.upper())
```

Now that you have a script, test that the `stdin` and arguments work as expected. This can be done using the `echo` command and pipes:

```sh
$ echo "i want a snag" | ./myScript.py Reader Universe
```
```
Hello Reader!<br>
Hello Universe!<br>
I WANT A SNAG
```

## Step 3: Add a snag to your Page

We now have a script and a page. Time to link them together with the `<snag>` tag. Modify `index.htsg` to include this:

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>＼（＾∀＾）メ（＾∀＾）ノ</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <snag a="./myScript.py" b="Reader" c="Universe">
            i want a snag
        </snag>
    </body>
</html>
```

This is the `snag` tag, which parses scripts. and writes the output onto the page. In this case, the tag will roughly write the output of this shell command:

```sh
$ echo "i want a snag" | ./myScript.py Reader Universe
```

The tag works like this:

### Content

The contents of the tag will be passed onto the script as `stdin`. You can access its contents in Python with `sys.stdin` or `input`.

### Attributes

Tag attributes are passed along to scripts as the following:

- The attribute keys must be ordered alphabetically.
- The attribute values are passed as a list of parameters to the script.

> **WARNING:** If the attributes in the tag are not in alphabetical order, the tag will be skipped.

#### Examples

| Tag                                                   | Parameters                    |
| :---------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| `<snag a="./myScript.py" b="Reader" c="Universe">`    | ./myScript.py Reader Universe |
| `<snag bad="./myScript" bed="Eggs">`                  | ./myScript Eggs               |
| `<snag c="./myScript.py" b="Fail">`                   | *(tag will be skipped)*       |

## Step 4: Compile into HTML

You are now ready to compile your pages into HTML. This is simply done just by running `snag` in the command line.

```sh
$ snag
```

If all goes well, you should now have an `index.html` file, which contains this:

```html
<!-- file autogenerated with snag -->
<html>
    <head>
        <title>＼（＾∀＾）メ（＾∀＾）ノ</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        Hello Reader!<br>
        Hello Universe!<br>
        I WANT A SNAG<br>
    </body>
</html>
```
